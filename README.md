## Introduction 📖

This repository showcases a framework built with Cypress for the  **Mission control dashboard 
full stack demo app**: [https://github.com/odziem/nasa-project](https://github.com/odziem/nasa-project)
It includes end-to-end tests, UI integration tests, and API integration tests.
The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design. Additionally, the `commands.ts` file includes custom commands serving as an additional abstraction layer. The `utils.ts` file contains utilty functions.


## DB state reset/test data preparation 🗃️

In terms of test data preparation, the repository demonstrates Mongo database state management through actions like dropping, creating, and populating collections before tests. Two functions 
utilizing the Mongoose ORM package handle cleaning and seeding test data. These functions are encapsulated within Cypress tasks for convenient access within spec files.
